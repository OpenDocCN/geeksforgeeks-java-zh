[Java](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/) 是 Sun 微系统开发的面向对象、平台无关的高级编程语言。它被认为是几乎所有类型的网络应用的基础。借助 Java 编程语言，我们可以开发和交付全球标准的嵌入式应用程序、移动应用程序、企业应用程序、游戏和基于网络的内容等。

**Java 的优势:**

*   Simple programming language
*   object-oriented programming
*   Platform independent
*   distributed computing
*   Security language
*   multithreading
*   Maintenance is cheap and economical.

**Java 的缺点:**

*   Single paradigm language
*   Memory consumption is higher than native compilation language.
*   Slow and poor performance.
*   Unsigned type
*   There is no such attractive look and feel as GUI.
*   Less machine interaction

[。NET](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-net-framework/) 是一个跨平台的开源软件框架，用于开发微软开发的软件应用程序。它支持下一代应用程序和 web 服务的构建和运行。在……的帮助下。NET，我们可以创建可重用的模块，因此，它使应用程序代码没有错误，并提高了生产率。

**的优点。NET :**

*   Multi-layer software architecture
*   Cross-platform design
*   object-oriented programming
*   Large cache system
*   Universal. NET standard
*   Flexible deployment and easy maintenance
*   ASP.NET automatic monitoring

**的缺点。NET:**

*   Limited object relation support
*   memory leak
*   Than native code
*   slow
*   Vendor lock-in migration applications are expensive.
*   The stability of the new version

| --- | --- |
| Java is an object-oriented and platform-independent high-level programming language. | . NET is a cross-platform open source software framework for developing software applications. |
| Developed by solar microsystems. | It was developed by Microsoft. |
| Java needs JVM (Java Virtual Machine) as a means of execution at runtime. | . NET needs the common language runtime as the means of execution at runtime. |
| It supports multiple operating systems and a third-party system. | Only Windows operating system is supported. |
| Compared with. NET, the garbage collection method provided by Java is less efficient. | . NET provides a more effective garbage collection method than Java. |
| Use JDBC (Java database connection) to connect databases in Java. | Yes. Control data object is used for database connection. |
| There are several third-party ide (Integrated Development Environment) available for Java. | It has a standard IDE (Integrated Development Environment), namely Microsoft Visual Studio. |
| It supports the interconnection architecture. | Support disconnected architecture. |
| It's a step behind. NET in the case of providing security. | In the case of providing security, it is the first step. |
| It provides a slightly more difficult concept of exception handling than. NET. | It provides an easier concept of exception handling than Java. |
